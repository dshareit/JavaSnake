For Project 2 I decided to re-create one of my all time favorite games growing up, Snake.

   Slimy the Snake:

        My program is a somewhat unique version of the world wide phenomenon that is "Snake". I starts off with a pre-menu
        that describes what the user is to do and also shows the title. (painted it myself)
        Then it jumps straight into the program and two frames pop up, first is the actual game the second is the instructions
        for playing. The user then plays until he/she runs into a wall or themselves. Finally the last screen appears that
        indicates that the game is over.

    Functionality:

        It functions just as regular snake, once you eat a "raseberry" your "slimy" will grow by one and continue growing as
        you eat more and more "raseberries".

   Why I decided to make this:

        I love games especially simple games that are really quick to play. Growing up I played a lot of snake and even though
        I played for hours and hours I never seemed to get bored. You always have to be proactive playing snake else you will end
        running into a wall or yourself. It gave me the ability to be creative as well, by not only programming it the way I wanted
        but also having the ability to create my own drawings, through the program "paint" and implement them into the game.


   Running the program:

        Very simple....select run and then it does everything else by itself you just have to worry about controlling the "slimy" once he appears.


   Credits:

        A special thank you to http://www.google.com, http://stackoverflow.com, http://zetcode.com/, and of course this course... without their help I would not have
        been able to make "Slimy" come to life.
